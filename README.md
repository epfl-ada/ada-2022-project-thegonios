# The history behind the movie plot

## Abstract
At first, when asked on 'what are movies made for?', one could easily answer 'for entertainment!'. But this is obviously not the only reason. Here we would like to focus on movies that are portraying History. Some stick to it conscientiously, other just use it as an environemnt for their original plot. However, by bringging the biggest events of the past century to the screen, these movies are made for the memory and so we can remember what the past was made of. In this project we are interested in the when and how do movies have portrayed historical events. We will dive into the plot summaries to identify events and perform multi-step analysis to investigate the way these were handled over time by considering the gender of the movies and the actors that played in them. 

## Research questions
1. Does the way of portraying a particular event changed over time ?
2. What is the relationship between movie gender and the event it portrayed ? 
3. Are there preferred actor ethnicity, age and gender distributions to cover an event?

## Additional datasets ?

## Methods
To identify historical events, we would create lexical fields related to the events using our personal knowledge, and the use of already existing lists of words on the web. Then we would parse each movie plot through these dictionnaries and count the number of words they have in common and how many times they occur. To avoid false positive we would set a threshold to accept a movie as portraying a particular event. Then we would get a cluster of movies assigned to each event we chose to study. These clusters would then first be analyzed individually to then compare them and observe if their are differences in covering of history in the movie industry.
